  title:        "Pseudo Random Number Generator"
  language:     "Verilog"
  description:  "This project implements a pseudo-random number generator using Verilog. It generates pseudo-random numbers and outputs them to drive two 7-segment displays."

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
    The pseudo-random number generator is based on LFSR. It takes three inputs:
    - `clk`: Clock input.
    - `en`: Enable signal.
    - `rst_n`: Active-low reset signal.
    
    The generator produces 8-bit pseudo-random numbers, which can be used to control two 7-segment displays.
    As source of pseudo-randomnes used 2 LFSRs. One that works with 8 bit and one with 16 bit. The circuit dont have input data, just 1 clock and 1 enable pin. The output will be a 7 segment display, so 14 output pins.
    The 16 bit LFSR produce the input of a 16-to-8 multiplexer and the 8 bit LFSR produce the selection bits of 16-to-8 multiplexer.
    The 16-to-8 multiplexer is implemented by 8 2-to-1 multiplexers.
    The final stage is convert the data readable by 2 7 segment displays.
